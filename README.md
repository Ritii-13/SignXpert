## We are going to attempt to create an American sign language translator

**Problem Statement:**

-> The lack of an accurate and user-friendly app for real-time translation of audio and video content into sign language and vice versa hinders effective communication and accessibility for individuals who are deaf/ hard of hearing or dumb . There is a need for an innovative solution that bridges the communication gap, empowering individuals with an access to interact with audio and video content seamlessly while facilitating inclusive and efficient communication with hearing individuals. There is a need for a solution that can detect sign language gestures and convert them into text or audio, and vice versa enabling seamless communication between sign language users and non-sign language users.

**Solution:**

-> Develop a user-friendly interface that enables the translation of audio and text content into sign language in the form of video and vice versa, with the aim of bridging the communication gap between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who use spoken language. The app should provide an intuitive and accurate solution for real-time translation, empowering deaf and speech-impaired individuals to access audio and video content more effectively, and facilitating effective communication between deaf and hearing individuals.

**Tech Stack:**

-> Frontend: HTML ,CSS , Javascript

-> Backend: Python

-> Database: SQL,MongoDb

-> Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV,media pipe

-> Framework: Figma,Django,Flask,react ,angular

-> APIs: Google Cloud Translation API,gesture dataset

**Features:**

-> Audio/Video/Text Translation
-> Sign Language to Audio/Video/Text Translation
-> Real-Time Translation
-> Accuracy and Adaptability
-> User-Friendly Interface
